# employee_tracker_command_line_app

## Description

Welcome to the Employee Tracker Command Line App. With this app, you'll be able to keep track of your company's basic employee information including departments, roles, employee names, salaries, and reporting structure.

While working on this project, I was able to practice TypeScript and PostgreSQL in addition to the Inquirer module, PG module, and dotenv module. In using Type Script in collaboration with PostgreSQL, I was able to practice creating databases, creating SQL tables, and querying data using pg from npm.
